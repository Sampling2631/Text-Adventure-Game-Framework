# This is where most of the code behind this framework is
# There's two parent classes, DisplayText and TakesInput. All classes that display text (including TakesInput) inherit
# DisplayText and all classes that take input inherit TakesInput.
#
# All of these classes have a do function. Every do function takes player and place. That way every one of these
# classes can be called in the playStory method of Playable. Every class that contains a playable list will inherit
# Playable. Then, in the Playable class's explore method, playStory will be called to play through a list, typically
# passed to the Playable class in the definition as story=[some story here].
#
# An example story class (a class that gets initialized in a list defined as a Playable class's story) would look like
# this:
#
# class SomeFunctionality(could inherit DisplaysText or TakesInput here):
#   def __init__(self, some arguments):
#       self.variable = some argument
#
#   def do(self, player, place):
#       # functionality implemented here using values passed on initialization
#
#       return (either a switch type or 1 to just go to the next item)
