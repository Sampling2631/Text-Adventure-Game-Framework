# Test Adventure Game Framework - Most Noticeably used in Almost-Gone


### How the System works
Story-play is node-based and works by exploring places (or scenes, which are simple places desgined for single use and only as a vessel for story). When you explore, you enter a **list**. That list is the story to play. The list contains object(s) which are of different classes.
The classes used are:
* **Display** - used for displaying text. Fun features, such as indents, smart new lines, color, and speaker-based color built in! (To utilize indents and smart new lines, define any needed paramaters and then use :t: for tab and :n: for new line, with your indent paramater automatically applied).
* **Conditional** - used for conditional aspeccts of the story. Depends on conditions to play certain lists. Still a work in progress as of yet.
* **Choice** - used when a choice is required. The choice is printed based on input, with custom display messages allowed for each item. All input is sanity checked against the allowed range. Will be integrated with SubPlaces more fully
* **Flag** - used for in-dictionary switching. When a string is returned by a **Switch**, it searches for a **Flag** with that string as the name.
* **Switch** - used for switching to other **Subplaces**, **Places**, **Routes**, **Flags**, and **more**. SubPlaces are currently still under development.
* **Lull** - used for slowing down the story experience (user sees a green > and presses enter to see the next block of text)
* **List** - used for multi-level listing (it returns a list to play through, makes things a little more readable)

### Note
Please note the file structure will be changing as a compiler is added (based in part on Rotri Salvatore (@DreadbotReporter7)'s input) and it is written into a Rust version, which will be in addition to the Python version.
